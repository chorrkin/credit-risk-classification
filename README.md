## Credit Risk Classification
## Objectives

This project applies supervised machine learning models to predict credit risk using the `lending_data.csv` dataset. It demonstrates the use of classification algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, random forest, and KNN. The analysis includes model evaluation using confusion matrices and classification reports, with and without RandomOversampling to address class imbalance. All code is executed in Google Colab using scikit-learn and pandas.
